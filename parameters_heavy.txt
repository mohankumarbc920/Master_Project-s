######### Parameters for ChromeBat algorithm ##################

#A .log and .pdb will be produced with this name
output_file=bat

#This is how many structures the algorithm should produce in addition to structures produced in an alpha search
#1 is the default value
structs=10


### Algorithm Parameters ###


#alpha is the conversion factor used to convert the contact matrix into a Distance matrix
#the formula for distance d based on contact rate c is d(c)=1/(c^alpha)
#If alpha is not found the ChromeBat will perform a search across alphas in [0,1]
alpha=0.1,0.3,0.5,0.7,0.9,1.0

#num_bats is how many bats the algo should simulate
#it impacts runtime linearly, that is doubling the amount of bats will double the runtime
num_bats=10

#generations is how many iterations of the algorithm will run
#also impacts runtime linearly
generations=10000

### Bat Behavioral Variables ###

#a bats frequency determines how aggressively it optimizes
#A bat with high frequency will fly toward the best known solution at high speed
min_freq=0
max_freq=0.1

#A bats volume determines how willing it is to accept a new solution
#A value of 0 means a bat will always never accept new solution and 1 means it always will
volume=0.9

#A bat's pulse rate determines how often it stops exploring and teleports to the current best known solution
#a pulse rate of 1 means it always appears at the best known solution
#a pulse rate of 0 means it never teleports 
pulse=0.9

#Perturbation determines how large of a random walk a bat performs after pulsing
#this is a constant factor multiplied by a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and std deviation 1 in all dimensions
perturbation=0.002,0.004,0.006,0.008,0.01
